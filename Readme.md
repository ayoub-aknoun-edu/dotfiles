# 🧰 Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal configuration files (**dotfiles**) used to set up and customize my development environment.
It serves as a **centralized backup and reference** for all my essential configs — so I can easily restore or replicate my setup on any new machine without starting from scratch.

---

## 💡 Purpose

These files reflect my personal preferences for productivity, aesthetics, and workflow efficiency.
The goal of this repo is to:

* Keep configuration files version-controlled and portable
* Simplify environment setup on new systems
* Share useful configurations with others who might find them helpful
* Allow quick recovery after a system reinstall or hardware change

---

## ⚙️ What’s Inside

This repo currently includes a few key configuration files such as:

* **Neovim** configuration (for code editing and plugin setup)
* **PowerShell** profile for command-line customization
* **Oh My Posh** theme configuration (`akanoun.omp.json`)

More configurations may be added over time — covering other tools, shells, editors, or environments I use regularly.

---

## 🚀 Usage

You can clone this repository on any machine to quickly restore your setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayoub-aknoun-edu/dotfiles.git
```

Then copy or symlink the files you need to the appropriate locations on your system.

> ⚠️ Some configurations may depend on external tools or themes (e.g. Neovim, Oh My Posh, PowerShell 7).
> Make sure to install them beforehand.
